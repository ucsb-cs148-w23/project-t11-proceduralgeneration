## Tech stack 
- front-end: React.js
- front-end deployment: firebase
- back-end: Flask (Python)
- back-end deployment: AWS EC2
- database/store: Firebase Cloud Storage or MongoDB

## Approach
We're planning to make a web app with interface elements to generate a 3D city model, download model files, and get/create a link for sharing.
As a stretch goal we would like to have options to manually edit tiles.
For the generation, we're planning to deploy a flask (python) back-end on an EC2 instance.

## User role
We have one user role. Our tool is designed for game developers who want to create city environment for video game 
but lack the time or knowledge to model an entire city environment.
This user wants to use procedural generation algorithms but without needing to learn game-engine specifics or buying permissions from commercial software.

## Permissions
We may later choose to implement login and authorization for sharing with permissions.
