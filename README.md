Teck stack we are using: AWS, Python, JavaScript,React, firebase or MongoDB


What we plan for the project: This project is desinged as an Web App, with frontend to support user log in, upload building and street model used to create the city, and share clickable link for generated city model. The algorithm is implemented by python in the backend. If we need more efficiency and we have spare time, we may convert it to c++. 


User roles: Designed for game developers who want to create city environment for video game but does not know how to do 3D model.
Their goals are using existing wave collapsing algorithm without using tools built in Unity, or buying permission from ArcGIS CityEngine


Permissions: Our app requires users to log in for using the app.
