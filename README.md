## Lab02 tech stack and user roles
Our tech stack will consist of a react frontend using three.js for 3D rendering framework. 
We will use firebase to host our app, mongodb to store models for easy link sharing.
Finally, we will use AWS api gateway + lambda for our backend (generation algorithm and db interaction).

Our web app has a single user role which is for game designers. This user creates a city model and shares it and downloads it.
