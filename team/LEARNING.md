## Tech Stack Finalized

# Frontend: React (Js/html/css)
https://mantine.dev/
Bootstrap also works

# API:
Maybe AWS but lambda costs money
Also kind of annoying to implement
Prolly Flask since no one knows Node
Perhaps C++ with Open Mesh
Plan:
Prototype with python (faster to build)
After MVP demo if we want to make it faster → convert to C++

# DB/Misc: 
Relational vs non-relational
Login → login using google account
Firebase DB (noSQL)
Algorithm is deterministic → maybe just generate a serial number? No → better to fetch object file from db
DB:
Storing object files
noSQL database
Firebase, MongoDB
If we deploy using firebase, might as well use firebase for the DB

## Plan to get good

Team: 
# Matthew
# Shuning 
Try to learn more about Web development and Unity
# Christine
Learn more about the ins and outs of Flask, look into using Mantine as a component library, learn more about open mesh & three.js, learn about using Firebase
If we need help, look to the people who know list for reference of who to ask for help :)
# Richard
Open mesh and fire base
# Andy
Start looking into React and Flask and getting the basics down. Then maybe visiting openmesh with python (and maybe c++ if we have time)
# Bryan
React, OpenMesh,
