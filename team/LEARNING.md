## Tech Stack Finalized

### Frontend: React (Js/html/css)
https://mantine.dev/
Bootstrap also works

### API:
- eliminated ideas: AWS lambda, Node
Plan:
- prototype with python + flask or fastapi for API
- given tighter performance requirements/extra time: convert to C++/OpenMesh

### DB/Misc: 
Use object store such as S3 or Firebase Cloud Storage for link sharing
-  firebase can handle (google) login and storage
-  noSQL (no features from relational DBs needed)

## Plan to get good
Team: 
- Matthew: Learn how to host python backend somewhere and firebase's cloud storage service.
- Shuning: Try to learn more about Web development and Unity
- Christine: Learn more about the ins and outs of Flask, look into using Mantine as a component library, learn more about open mesh & three.js, learn about using Firebase. If we need help, look to the people who know list for reference of who to ask for help :)
- Richard: Open mesh and fire base
- Andy: Start looking into React and Flask and getting the basics down. Then maybe visiting openmesh with python (and maybe c++ if we have time)
- Bryan: React, OpenMesh
