# Testing Documentation

## Unit Tests
1) Unit tests were implemented for two of the helper functions in wfc.py in the backend using python unittest and parameterized. The unit test is located in the backend folder <br>

2) Going forward, it would be great to write unit tests for the rest of the helper functions that are in wfc.py as well as any helper functions we create in the future. In addition, we plan to increase the depth of testing by adding more test cases. <br>

## Component/Integration Testing
3) Component testing was implemented for the header component in the frontend using the React Testing Library. (frontend/src/components in the __tests__ folder) <br>

4) Going forward, it would be cool to continue to further explore other testing libraries as well as other higher level testing frameworks. We plan to continue writing component tests for the other components as well as possibly explore other frameworks such as Storybook since there were a few issues that we ran into with Jest through using the React Testing Library. <br>
