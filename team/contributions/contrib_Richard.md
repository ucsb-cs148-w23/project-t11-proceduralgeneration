## Contributions

- Helped test and debug frontend features
- Designed labeling scheme for adjacency rules through model sockets and prototypes.
- Labeled initial set of sockets for default models.
- Created script for generating adjacency rules given labeled model sockets
- Created scripts to automate model socket labeling and adjacency generation to pass into the final constraint solver
