# User Feedback Needs
## Ease of Usability
It would be helpful to get feedback on how usable the site is to new users. For example, if a new user is on the site for the first time, how difficult is it to figure out how to generate and subsequently customize a model? How long does it take for a user to make an account and begin to save models along with view those saved models? Overall, we would like to analyze the learning curve for new users on our site and gain insight into which components we can improve the usability of.

## Usefulness
We have a subset of new features that were added subsequent to the MVP demo that added a lot of functionality for users, specifically with regards to greatly increasing the customizability of our models and allowing users to save their creation through the creation of user accounts and link sharing. We would appreciate any feedback from users on what they found helpful and perhaps not as helpful. For example, would they prefer the ability to save their model over the ability to customize tiles? How much do users appreciate the ability to change the name of their saved models? Which features would the like to have added that would increase the efficiency in which they can use the site?

## Speed / Errors
We have currently tested most of our components on our end but it would be really helpful to gain insight to any errors or edge cases that may come up on the users' end. In addition, it would be useful to get feedback on the performance of the site as a whole. Does it time out at any point? Does it take more than a couple seconds to generate a new model or to pull up the popup for saved models?
