## Dimensions
We wish users to test input slider bars for picking dimensions on main page, and then respond that if they are satisfied with current range and accuracy. (For instance, do they want to have 0.1 gap rather than 1 gap, do they want smaller range or larger range)

## customize options
We wish users to respond that if they feel options for customize models are too complicated or too easy to use.

## overall performance
we want know that after testing our product and read the readme description, if users feel our product matches our description and satisfy their requirement.
