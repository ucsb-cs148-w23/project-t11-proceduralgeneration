## Date of Retrospective: 02/17/2023

Led by: Andy <br>

## Action item

* a goal: Start tailoring code to be testable and implement tests for the product.
* a change: Make sure there are multiple reviewers before merging branches.
* a measurement: We know we are headed in the right direction when less conflicts/bugs happen and we are able to easily create tests for the code that we've written.

## Retro Assessment
* For this retro, we decided to keep using the start/stop/continue method that we used for Retro 1. I think this system fits really well for our team as it is very straightforward and lets us clearly identify what needs to be done/changed.
* After a successful MVP deployment, taking the next steps to add to our product and make sure everything is thoroughly tested is the primary goal that the team decided on moving forward today. Overall, discussion went well and many echoed the same sentiments about testing being the next focus.
* Based on today's retro, one piece of advice I'd give to the next retro leader is to try to just listen to everybody's thoughts and opinions with an open mind.
